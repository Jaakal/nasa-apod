# NASA - A Picture of the Day

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, some along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.

Created a catalog of images from NASA. The application uses three different NASA API's:

**1.** ASOP (A Picture of the Day) - every day a new picture with an explanation is uploaded.

**2.** EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) - Random picture from the set of the day is displayed.

**3.** Mars Rover Photos - This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars. The application randomly chooses one picture from the set of the day, if there is any.

The application has filters on the main page to separate pictures by API and date gap. Every picture is clickable and when clicking on a picture a separate page for that specific picture is displayed in full-scale and with details.
